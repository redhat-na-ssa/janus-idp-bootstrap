# Janus IDP Demo with Ansible

A guide to installing the `Janus IDP Demo with Ansible`.  An [instructional video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TJZLEwKFJer5RMpKn3rh9w2ftYGChPtg/view) walking through the setup is available for reference.

> **_NOTE:_** This demo was developed with the [Janus IDP Demo](https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?search=janus&item=babylon-catalog-prod%2Fcommunity-content.com-janus-idp.prod) catalog item on the Red Hat Demo Platform as the intended target for deployment.  Though not supported, the full setup and demo should work on any OpenShift 4.12+ cluster.
## Prerequisites

- [oc](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html) (4.11+)
- [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)/[ansible-galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/)
- [helm](https://helm.sh/)
  - Please use the version included with your Openshift Deployment
- [pip3](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

## Install Packages

1. The Ansible `kubernetes.core` and `community.hashi_vault` collections need to be installed before using this playbook.

    ``` sh
    ansible-galaxy collection install kubernetes.core community.hashi_vault
    ```

1. The `kubernetes`, `openshift`, `hvac`, and `PyYAML` python packages need to be installed before using this playbook.

    ``` sh
    pip3 install --user kubernetes openshift hvac PyYAML
    ```

1. The `helm diff` plugin should to be installed before using this playbook.

    ``` sh
    helm plugin install https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff
    ```

## Configuration

Log in to your OpenShift cluster via the `oc` client.  Set the `OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER_INFO` variable for use later.

``` sh
export OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER_INFO=$(oc cluster-info | head -n 1 | sed 's/^.*https...api//' | sed 's/.6443.*$//' )
```

If you are using Linux environment, set the alias for the following commands to work:

``` sh
alias open="xdg-open"
```

For the remaining environment variables, it may be preferable to make use of `./env.sh` file provided at the root of this project.  Fill in the listed env vars as you complete the setup configuration, then run `source ./env.sh`.

### Create GitHub Organization

Create a new [Github Organization](https://github.com/account/organizations/new?plan=free). This organization will contain the code repositories for the `components` created by Backstage.

The `GITHUB_ORGANIZATION` environment variable will be set to the name of the Organization. You may also use any organization you are a member of, as long as you have the ability to create new repositories within it.

``` sh
export GITHUB_ORGANIZATION=
```

### Set Up GitHub Application

1. Create a new GitHub Application to use the `Git WebHooks` functionality in this demo.  The required field will be populated, and correct permissions set.

    ``` sh
    open "https://github.com/organizations/$GITHUB_ORGANIZATION/settings/apps/new?name=$GITHUB_ORGANIZATION-webhook&url=https://janus-idp.io/blog&webhook_active=false&public=false&administration=write&checks=write&actions=write&contents=write&statuses=write&vulnerability_alerts=write&dependabot_secrets=write&deployments=write&discussions=write&environments=write&issues=write&packages=write&pages=write&pull_requests=write&repository_hooks=write&repository_projects=write&secret_scanning_alerts=write&secrets=write&security_events=write&workflows=write&webhooks=write"
    ```

1. Set the `GITHUB_APP_ID` and `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID` environment variables to the App ID  and App Client ID, respectively. Generate a new client secret and set the `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable.  Then, generate a `Private Key` for this app and **download** the private key file.  Set the `GITHUB_KEY_FILE` environment variable to the downloaded file, using either the absolute path or the path relative to the `ansible/cluster-setup` directory.

    ``` sh
    export GITHUB_APP_ID=
    ```

    ``` sh
    export GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID=
    ```

    ``` sh
    export GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=
    ```

    ``` sh
    export GITHUB_KEY_FILE=
    ```

### Create Github OAuth Applications

Create an GitHub OAuth application in order to use GitHub as an Identity Provider for Backstage.

``` sh
open "https://github.com/settings/applications/new?oauth_application[name]=$GITHUB_ORGANIZATION-identity-provider&oauth_application[url]=https://janus-demo.apps$OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER_INFO&oauth_application[callback_url]=https://keycloak-backstage.apps$OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER_INFO/auth/realms/backstage/broker/github/endpoint"
```

Set the `GITHUB_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables with the values from the OAuth application.

``` sh
export GITHUB_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=
```

``` sh
export GITHUB_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

![Get Client ID](/docs/docs/getting_started/assets/client-info.png)

Create a **second** GitHub OAuth application to enable Dev Spaces to seamlessly push code changes to the repository for new components created in Backstage.

``` sh
open "https://github.com/settings/applications/new?oauth_application[name]=$GITHUB_ORGANIZATION-dev-spaces&oauth_application[url]=https://devspaces.apps$OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER_INFO&oauth_application[callback_url]=https://devspaces.apps$OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER_INFO/api/oauth/callback"
```

Set the `GITHUB_DEV_SPACES_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_DEV_SPACES_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables will the values from the OAuth application.

``` sh
export GITHUB_DEV_SPACES_CLIENT_ID=
```

``` sh
export GITHUB_DEV_SPACES_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

Create a **third** GitHub OAuth application to enable the numerous Backstage plugins utilizing GitHub to authenticate and access the relevant data.

``` sh
open "https://github.com/settings/applications/new?oauth_application[name]=$GITHUB_ORGANIZATION-backstage&oauth_application[url]=https://janus-demo.apps$OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER_INFO&oauth_application[callback_url]=https://janus-demo.apps$OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER_INFO/api/auth/github/handler/frame"
```

Set the `GITHUB_BACKSTAGE_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_BACKSTAGE_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables will the values from the OAuth application.

``` sh
export GITHUB_BACKSTAGE_CLIENT_ID=
```

``` sh
export GITHUB_BACKSTAGE_CLIENT_SECRET=
```
## Install

Clone the `demo-setup` repo and run the next commands from inside of the `ansible/cluster-setup` directory

```sh
git clone https://github.com/janus-idp/{{ .Values.git.infraRepoName }}
cd demo-setup/ansible/cluster-setup
```

### Run the Software Templates Setup Playbook

Fork the [Software Templates](https://github.com/janus-idp/software-templates/fork) repository to your organization. Ensure that the name of the forked repo remains as `software-templates`

Execute the following command to complete setup of the fork. This playbook will customize your fork of the Software Templates repo with relevant information pertaining to your cluster, and mimic the structure of a custom template being used in an enterprise IT environment.

```sh
ansible-playbook ./template.yaml
```

### Run the Cluster Setup Playbook

[Inventory values](inventory/group_vars/all.yml) can be changed, but it is not required

Run Command:

```sh
ansible-playbook site.yaml -i inventory
```

> **_NOTE:_** The deployment of most infrastructure is delegated to ArgoCD.  Once the playbook successfully runs, it may take several minutes until the demo is fully operational. The deployment can be monitored in the ArgoCD console.

The cluster is now set up to run the Janus IDP Demo.  Please refer to the [Architecture](https://janus-idp.io/demo-setup/architecture/) and [Demo](https://janus-idp.io/demo-setup/demo/) sections for further guidance. 


To create a local copy of the requisite environment variables for future use, run the following command:

```sh
echo "export GITHUB_ORGANIZATION=$GITHUB_ORGANIZATION

export GITHUB_APP_ID=$GITHUB_APP_ID
export GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID=$GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID
export GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=$GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET
export GITHUB_KEY_FILE=$GITHUB_KEY_FILE

export GITHUB_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=$GITHUB_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID
export GITHUB_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET=$GITHUB_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET

export GITHUB_DEV_SPACES_CLIENT_ID=$GITHUB_DEV_SPACES_CLIENT_ID
export GITHUB_DEV_SPACES_CLIENT_SECRET=$GITHUB_DEV_SPACES_CLIENT_SECRET

export GITHUB_BACKSTAGE_CLIENT_ID=$GITHUB_BACKSTAGE_CLIENT_ID
export GITHUB_BACKSTAGE_CLIENT_SECRET=$GITHUB_BACKSTAGE_CLIENT_SECRET" > env.sh
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Stuck on `FAILED - RETRYING: [localhost]: Wait for Keycloak to be Ready (xxx retries left)` for over 2 minutes

Bounce the pod deployed by the `keycloak` StatefulSet in the `backstage` namespace.  The playbook will pick up again once the new pod is up.

#### Failed on `Run RHSSO Backstage Helm Chart` during initial run `no matches for kind \"Keycloak\" in version...`

The RHSSO operator may not have completed installation, try rerunning the Ansible Playbook.

#### Log in to Argo Cluster

There are ArgoCD instances in the following namespaces:

- `janus-argocd`
- `infra-argocd`

To access the console, the password for the `admin` user can be found in the `argocd-cluster` secret.

#### Failed on `Fetching Default Service Account Token` with `unknown command \"token default\"`

Ensure your `oc` client is 4.11 or above.

```sh
oc version --client
```

The latest `oc` client can be downloaded here:

```sh
open "https://console-openshift-console.apps$OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER_INFO/command-line-tools"
```
